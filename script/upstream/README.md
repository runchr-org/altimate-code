# Upstream Merge Runbook

We maintain a fork of [anomalyco/opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode). This directory contains automation to merge upstream releases into our fork while preserving our customizations and rebranding user-facing surfaces.

## Fork Strategy

- **Internal names are kept as-is** — `@opencode-ai/`, `OPENCODE_*` env vars, `packages/opencode/`, `.opencode/` config dir. This minimizes merge conflicts and keeps upstream compatibility.
- **User-facing surfaces are rebranded** — domains (`altimate.ai`), GitHub org (`AltimateAI`), product name (`Altimate Code`), install commands, app IDs.
- **Custom code is protected** — files in `keepOurs` patterns are never overwritten by upstream. Our Python engine, bridge layer, altimate tools, and CI workflows stay untouched.
- **Upstream-only packages are skipped** — platform packages (app, web, desktop, etc.), nix, SST infra, and translated READMEs are discarded during merge.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# 1. Make sure the upstream remote exists
git remote -v | grep upstream
# If missing:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode.git

# 2. Install merge tooling dependencies
cd script/upstream && bun install && cd ../..

# 3. Ensure your working tree is clean
git status  # should show no uncommitted changes
```

## Step-by-Step Merge Process

### 1. Check available upstream versions

```bash
bun run script/upstream/list-versions.ts
```

This shows upstream tags, their merge status (merged/available), and how many commits behind we are. It suggests the next version to merge.

### 2. Preview what will change (dry-run)

```bash
bun run script/upstream/merge.ts --version v1.2.21 --dry-run
```

This categorizes every file that would change:
- **Keep ours** (green) — auto-resolved by keeping our version
- **Skip files** (cyan) — upstream-only, auto-accepted then deleted
- **Lock files** (yellow) — regenerated via `bun install`
- **Transformable** (magenta) — branding transforms applied
- **Pass-through** (dim) — accepted from upstream without changes

Review this to understand the scope before proceeding.

### 3. Run the merge

```bash
bun run script/upstream/merge.ts --version v1.2.21
```

The script will:
1. Create a backup branch (`backup/main-<timestamp>`)
2. Create a merge branch (`upstream/merge-v1.2.21`)
3. Run `git merge v1.2.21`
4. Auto-resolve conflicts using keepOurs/skipFiles/lock-files strategies
5. Apply branding transforms to user-facing text
6. Restore our package names and versions

**If there are no remaining conflicts**, the script commits, pushes, and prints a PR creation command.

**If conflicts remain**, the script exits with a list of files to fix manually. See next step.

### 4. Resolve remaining conflicts (if any)

```bash
# See what's still conflicted
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# Open each file, resolve the <<<< ==== >>>> markers
# Pay attention to `altimate_change` markers — they delimit our custom code

# Stage resolved files
git add <resolved-file>

# Resume the merge (picks up from branding transforms onward)
bun run script/upstream/merge.ts --continue
```

### 5. Verify branding

```bash
bun run script/upstream/analyze.ts --branding
```

This scans the codebase for upstream branding that may have leaked through (e.g., `opencode.ai` URLs, `anomalyco` GitHub refs). Exit code 1 means leaks were found.

```bash
# For full details on each leak
bun run script/upstream/analyze.ts --branding --verbose
```

Some matches are false positives (internal names we intentionally keep). If you find real leaks, either:
- Add a branding rule in `utils/config.ts`
- Or fix the specific file manually

### 6. Verify typecheck and tests

```bash
bun install
bunx turbo typecheck
bun run --cwd packages/opencode test
```

### 7. Create the PR

The merge script prints a `gh pr create` command at the end. Review the diff, then merge.

## CLI Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `bun run script/upstream/list-versions.ts` | List upstream tags with merge status |
| `bun run script/upstream/merge.ts --version <tag>` | Run full merge |
| `bun run script/upstream/merge.ts --dry-run --version <tag>` | Preview changes only |
| `bun run script/upstream/merge.ts --continue` | Resume after conflict resolution |
| `bun run script/upstream/merge.ts --no-push --version <tag>` | Merge without pushing |

## Configuration

All config lives in `utils/config.ts` (TypeScript for type safety). Key sections:

### `keepOurs` — Files we own entirely

These are auto-resolved by keeping our version during conflicts:

| Pattern | What it protects |
|---------|-----------------|
| `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc. | Our documentation |
| `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/actions/**` | Our CI/CD |
| `packages/altimate-engine/**` | Python engine (100% our code) |
| `packages/opencode/src/altimate/**` | Custom TypeScript tools |
| `packages/opencode/src/bridge/**` | Python-TS JSON-RPC bridge |
| `script/upstream/**` | This merge tooling |
| `experiments/**`, `docs/**`, `.claude/**` | Research and AI config |
| `install` | Our install script |
| `sdks/**` | Our SDKs |

### `skipFiles` — Upstream packages we don't use

These are accepted from upstream then effectively discarded (deleted from our repo):

| Pattern | Why we skip it |
|---------|---------------|
| `packages/app/**`, `packages/web/**` | Hosted platform UI |
| `packages/desktop/**`, `packages/desktop-electron/**` | Desktop app |
| `packages/console/**`, `packages/enterprise/**` | SaaS features |
| `packages/docs/**`, `packages/ui/**` | Upstream docs/components |
| `packages/extensions/**`, `packages/slack/**` | Integrations |
| `packages/function/**`, `packages/identity/**` | Serverless/auth |
| `packages/containers/**`, `packages/storybook/**` | Container/Storybook |
| `infra/**`, `sst.config.ts`, `sst-env.d.ts` | SST cloud infrastructure |
| `nix/**`, `flake.nix`, `flake.lock` | Nix packaging |
| `specs/**` | Upstream project specs |
| `README.*.md` | Translated READMEs |

### `preservePatterns` — Lines excluded from branding transforms

Lines containing these strings are left untouched to avoid breaking internal code:

- `@opencode-ai/` — npm package scope
- `packages/opencode` — internal directory path
- `OPENCODE_` — environment variables
- `.opencode/` — config directory
- `opencode.json` — config filenames
- `import { ` — import statements

### Branding Rules

Ordered most-specific-first to prevent partial matches. Categories:

| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| URL subdomains | `docs.opencode.ai` -> `docs.altimate.ai` |
| Root domain | `opencode.ai` -> `altimate.ai` |
| GitHub org/repos | `anomalyco/opencode` -> `AltimateAI/altimate-code` |
| Container registry | `ghcr.io/anomalyco` -> `ghcr.io/AltimateAI` |
| Emails | `bot@opencode.ai` -> `bot@altimate.ai` |
| App IDs | `ai.opencode.desktop` -> `ai.altimate.code.desktop` |
| Social | `x.com/altaborodin` -> `x.com/Altimateinc` |
| Product name | `OpenCode` -> `Altimate Code` |
| Install commands | `npm i -g opencode-ai` -> `npm i -g @altimateai/altimate-code` |
| Homebrew | `anomalyco/tap/opencode` -> `AltimateAI/tap/altimate-code` |

### Adding a new branding rule

1. Open `utils/config.ts`
2. Add your rule to the appropriate category array
3. Place more specific patterns BEFORE less specific ones
4. Test: `bun run script/upstream/analyze.ts --branding`

```typescript
// Example: adding a new subdomain
{
  pattern: /newservice\.opencode\.ai/g,
  replacement: "newservice.altimate.ai",
  description: "New service subdomain",
},
```

## Change Markers

When we modify upstream files (not fully custom ones), we wrap our changes with markers:

```typescript
// altimate_change start — description of what we changed
... our modifications ...
// altimate_change end
```

These help during conflict resolution — you can see exactly what we changed vs upstream code. The `analyze.ts` script audits for unclosed marker blocks.

## Troubleshooting

### "Working tree has uncommitted changes"

Commit or stash your work before merging:
```bash
git stash
bun run script/upstream/merge.ts --version v1.2.21
git stash pop
```

### Conflicts remain after auto-resolution

This is normal for complex merges. The script lists exactly which files need manual resolution. Look for `altimate_change` markers to understand what's ours vs upstream.

### Branding leaks after merge

Run `bun run script/upstream/analyze.ts --branding --verbose` to see details. Common fixes:
- Add a new rule in `utils/config.ts` if it's a pattern we should always replace
- Add to `preservePatterns` if it's a false positive
- Fix manually if it's a one-off

### Upstream remote not found

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode.git
git fetch upstream --tags
```

### Aborting a merge

```bash
git merge --abort
git checkout main
git branch -D upstream/merge-v1.2.21
```

### Recovering from a failed merge

The script creates a backup branch before starting:
```bash
git branch | grep backup/
git checkout main
git reset --hard backup/main-<timestamp>
```

### State file left behind

If interrupted, delete the state file:
```bash
rm .upstream-merge-state.json
```

## Inspiration

This tooling was inspired by [Kilo-Org/kilocode](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)'s upstream merge automation, adapted for Altimate Code's fork structure and branding requirements.
