/**
 * Shared warehouse resolution for finops.* handlers.
 *
 * The finops tools (analyze_credits, query_history, etc.) all need to map a
 * caller-supplied warehouse name to a configured connection and validate that
 * its driver type supports the requested operation. Before this helper, each
 * handler returned `{ success: false, error: "Credit analysis is not available
 * for unknown warehouses." }` when the warehouse was missing or unknown —
 * which the LLM cannot fix because the error doesn't say which warehouses are
 * available or how to add one.
 *
 * Telemetry (memory/telemetry-analysis-2026-05-21.md) showed `finops_*` tools
 * at 100% error rate. The dominant failure mode was the LLM passing an
 * unconfigured warehouse name and getting a dead-end response. This helper
 * fixes both: it falls back to the first compatible warehouse when none is
 * specified, and produces actionable errors when resolution fails.
