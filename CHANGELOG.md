# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.18] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Native GitLab MR review** — review merge requests directly from your terminal with `altimate gitlab review <MR_URL>`. Supports self-hosted GitLab instances, nested group paths, and comment deduplication (updates existing review instead of posting duplicates). Requires `GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `GITLAB_TOKEN` env var. (#622)
- **Altimate LLM Gateway provider** — connect to Altimate's managed model gateway via the TUI provider dialog (select a provider → "Altimate"). Credentials validated before save, stored at `~/.altimate/altimate.json` with `0600` permissions. (#606)

### Fixed

- **Glob tool: timeout, home/root blocking, default exclusions** — glob searches now timeout after 30s (returning partial results) instead of hanging indefinitely. Scanning `/` or `~` is blocked with a helpful message. Common directories (`node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `.venv`) are excluded by default. (#637)
- **MCP config normalization** — configs using `mcpServers` (Claude Code, Cursor format) are auto-converted to `mcp` at load time. External server entries with `command` + `args` + `env` are transformed to altimate-code's native format. (#639)
- **Light theme readability** — fixed white-on-white text in light terminal themes by adding explicit foreground colors to markdown and code blocks. (#640)

## [0.5.17] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **Custom dbt `profiles.yml` path resolution** — Altimate Code now resolves `profiles.yml` using dbt's standard priority: explicit path → `DBT_PROFILES_DIR` env var → project-local `profiles.yml` → `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`. Teams using `DBT_PROFILES_DIR` in CI get zero-friction auto-discovery. Jinja `{{ env_var('NAME') }}` patterns are resolved automatically. A warning is shown when `DBT_PROFILES_DIR` is set but the file is not found. (#605)

### Fixed

- **ClickHouse: SQL comment injection bypass** — Comments could previously mask write statements from the read-only LIMIT guard. String literals are now stripped before comment removal to prevent false matches. (#591)
- **ClickHouse: `LowCardinality(Nullable(...))` nullability** — Schema inspection previously reported these columns as non-nullable; now correctly detected as nullable. (#591)
- **ClickHouse: connection lifecycle guards** — All query methods now throw a clear error if called before `connect()`, preventing cryptic TypeErrors. (#591)
- **ClickHouse: `binds` parameter handling** — Queries with parameterized binds no longer throw a driver error; the parameter is safely ignored (ClickHouse uses `query_params` natively). (#591)
- **Stale file retry loops on WSL and network drives** — `FileTime.read()` now uses filesystem mtime instead of wall-clock, eliminating 782-iteration retry loops caused by clock skew on WSL (NTFS-over-9P), NFS, and CIFS mounts. Set `OPENCODE_DISABLE_FILETIME_CHECK=true` as escape hatch if needed. (#611)
- **Error classification: `file_stale` split and keyword fix** — `file_stale` is now a distinct error class; HTTP 4xx errors no longer misclassify as validation failures; restored `"does not exist"` keyword for SQL errors like `"column foo does not exist"`. (#611, #614)

## [0.5.16] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **ClickHouse support** — Connect to ClickHouse Cloud, self-hosted clusters, or local Docker instances running ClickHouse 23.3+. Supports HTTP/HTTPS, TLS mutual auth, and dbt-clickhouse adapter auto-discovery. Includes MergeTree optimization guidance, materialized view design, partition pruning analysis, and query history via `system.query_log`. Requires `npm install @clickhouse/client` (#574)

### Fixed

- **Agent loop detection** — The agent now detects when a single tool is called 30+ times in a session (a pattern seen with runaway tool loops) and pauses for confirmation before continuing. Complements the existing same-input repetition detection (#587)
- **Improved error diagnostics** — Tool failures now report more specific error categories (`not_configured`, `file_not_found`, `edit_mismatch`, `resource_exhausted`) instead of generic "unknown" classification, improving support triage (#587)
- **Session environment metadata** — `session_start` telemetry now includes `os`, `arch`, and `node_version` for environment-based segmentation (#587)

## [0.5.15] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Plan agent two-step approach** — outline first, confirm, then expand; plan refinement loop with edit-in-place (capped at 5 revisions); approval phrase detection ("looks good", "proceed", "lgtm") (#556)
- **Feature discovery & progressive disclosure** — contextual suggestions after warehouse connection (schema, SQL, lineage, PII); dbt auto-detection recommending `/dbt-develop`, `/dbt-troubleshoot` (#556)

### Fixed

- **SQL classifier fallback security hardening** — invert fallback to whitelist reads (not blacklist writes), handle multi-statement SQL, strip line comments, fix `HARD_DENY_PATTERN` `\s` → `\b`; fix `computeSqlFingerprint` referencing undefined `core` after safe-import refactor (#582)
- **Edit tool nearest-match error messages** — `buildNotFoundMessage` with Levenshtein similarity search shows closest file content when `oldString` not found, helping LLM self-correct (#582)
- **Webfetch failure caching and actionable errors** — session-level URL failure cache (404/410/451) with 5-min TTL; status-specific error messages telling the model whether to retry; URL sanitization in errors to prevent token leakage (#582)
- **Nested `node_modules` in `NODE_PATH`** — `@altimateai/altimate-core` NAPI resolution now works for npm's hoisted and nested layouts (#576)
- **Null guards across 8 tool formatters** — prevent literal `undefined` in user-facing output for sql-analyze, schema-inspect, sql-translate, dbt-manifest, finops, and warehouse tools; DuckDB auto-retry on `database is locked` (#571)
- **Telemetry error classification** — add `http_error` class, expand connection/validation/permission patterns, redact sensitive keys in input signatures (#566)
- **Pre-release review findings** — remove dead code, fix `classifySkillTrigger()` unknown trigger handling, add null guards in lineage/translate tools (#580)
- **Binary alias hard copy** — use `cp` instead of symlink for `altimate-code` binary alias to fix cross-platform compatibility (#578)

### Testing

- Verdaccio sanity suite: 50 new tests across 3 phases, added to CI and release workflows (#560, #562)
- 12 new tests for `buildNotFoundMessage`, `computeSqlFingerprint`, and webfetch error messages (#582)

## [0.5.14] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- **MongoDB driver support** — 11th supported database with full MQL command set (find, aggregate, CRUD, indexes), BSON type serialization, schema introspection via document sampling, and cross-database queries; includes 90 E2E tests (#482)
- **Skill follow-up suggestions** — contextual "What's Next?" suggestions after skill completion to reduce first-run churn; maps 12 skills to relevant follow-ups with warehouse discovery nudge (#546)
- **`altimate-dbt build` without `--model`** — builds the entire dbt project via `unsafeBuildProjectImmediately`, replacing the separate `build-project` command (#546)
- **`upstream_fix:` marker convention** — new tag for temporary upstream bug fixes with `--audit-fixes` command to review carried fixes before upstream merges (#555)
- **Verdaccio-based sanity suite** — local npm registry test harness for real install verification, smoke tests, and upgrade scenarios (#503)

### Fixed

- **Locale duration days/hours swap** — `Locale.duration()` for values ≥24h showed wrong days/hours (total hours instead of remainder); e.g., 25h now correctly shows `1d 1h` (#529)
- **Dispatcher `reset()` not clearing lazy registration hook** — `reset()` only cleared handlers but left `_ensureRegistered` alive, causing flaky test failures (#529)
- **Impact analysis showing project-wide test count** — was using `manifest.test_count` (all tests in project) instead of counting only tests referencing the target model (#529)
- **Prototype pollution in `SkillFollowups.get()`** — `FOLLOWUPS["__proto__"]` traversed `Object.prototype`; fixed with `Object.hasOwn()` guard (#558)
- **Shallow freeze in `SkillFollowups.get()`** — `Object.freeze()` on array didn't freeze nested objects, allowing shared state mutation; fixed with deep copy (#558)
- **CI Bun segfault resilience** — Bun 1.3.x crashes during test cleanup now handled by checking actual pass/fail summary instead of exit code (#555)

### Testing

- 52 adversarial tests for v0.5.14 release: `SkillFollowups` injection/boundary/immutability, `Locale.duration` tier transitions, `Dispatcher.reset` hook cleanup (#558)
- Consolidated 39 test PRs — 1,173 new tests across session, provider, MCP, CLI stats, bus, and utility modules (#498, #514, #545)

## [0.5.13] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **Pin `@altimateai/altimate-core` to exact version** — prevents npm from resolving stale cached binaries during install (#475)
- **Flaky `dbt Profiles Auto-Discovery` tests in CI** — stabilized tests that failed intermittently due to timing issues

### Changed

- **Bump `yaml` from 2.8.2 to 2.8.3** — dependency update in `packages/opencode` (#473)

## [0.5.12] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **`altimate-dbt` auto-discover config** — `altimate-dbt` commands now auto-detect `dbt_project.yml` and Python from the current directory without requiring `altimate-dbt init` first; supports Windows paths (`Scripts/`, `.exe`, `path.delimiter`) (#464)
- **Local E2E sanity test harness** — Docker-based test suite (`test/sanity/`) for install verification, smoke tests, upgrade scenarios, and resilience checks; runnable via `bun run sanity` (#461)

### Fixed

- **`altimate-dbt` commands fail with hardcoded CI path** — published binary contained a baked-in `/home/runner/work/...` path for the Python bridge; `copy-python.ts` now patches `__dirname` to use `import.meta.dirname` at runtime (#467)

### Testing

- 42 adversarial tests for config auto-discovery and dbt resolution: `findProjectRoot` edge cases (deep nesting, symlinks, nonexistent dirs), `discoverPython` with broken symlinks and malicious env vars, `resolveDbt` with conflicting env vars and priority ordering, `validateDbt` timeout/garbage handling, Windows constant correctness, `path.delimiter` usage, `buildDbtEnv` mutation safety
- 484-line adversarial test suite for the `__dirname` patch: regex edge cases, ReDoS protection, mutation testing, idempotency, CI smoke test parity, bundle runtime structure validation

## [0.5.11] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- **README changelog gap** — updated README to reflect releases v0.5.1 through v0.5.11; previous README only listed up to v0.5.0
- **npm publish transient 404s** — added retry logic (3 attempts with backoff) to `publish.ts` for concurrent scoped package publishes that hit npm registry race conditions

## [0.5.10] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **`altimate-code check` CLI command** — deterministic SQL checks (linting, formatting, style) that run without an LLM, suitable for CI pipelines and pre-commit hooks (#453)
- **Data-viz skill improvements** — lazy initialization, data-code separation, color contrast rules, icon semantics, field validation, and pre-delivery checklist (#434)

### Fixed

- **Snowflake Cortex not visible before authentication** — provider now appears in the provider list even when not yet authenticated (#447)
- **New user detection race condition** — first-run welcome flow and telemetry events could fire out of order or be skipped entirely (#445)
- **52 CI test failures from `mock.module` leaking across files** — test isolation fix for the new `check` command e2e tests (#460)
- **Missing `altimate_change` marker** — added required upstream marker on `isStatelessCommand` guard to pass Marker Guard CI (#457)

### Changed

- **Rename Recap back to Trace** — reverted the Recap branding to Trace across 29 files for better AI model comprehension of session recording concepts (#443)

### Testing

- Consolidated 12 hourly test PRs into single batch: slugify, hints sort, skill formatting, batch tools, filesystem utilities, wildcard matching — 1,680 new test lines (#439)
- `altimate-code check` unit + e2e test suites (1,687 lines) (#453)
- Snowflake Cortex provider visibility tests (#447)

## [0.5.9] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **Codespaces support** — skip machine-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` that lacks repo access, cap provider retries to prevent infinite loops, fix phantom `/discover-and-add-mcps` command that was missing from builtin commands (#415)
- **`sql_analyze` reports "unknown error" for successful analyses** — tool returned error status even when analysis completed successfully (AI-5975) (#426)
- **Remove `semver` dependency from upgrade path** — replaced with zero-dependency version comparison to prevent users getting locked on old versions when `semver` fails to load (#421)
- **Ship `discover-and-add-mcps` as a builtin command** — moved from `.opencode/command/` config directory to embedded template so it works out of the box (#409)

### Testing

- Comprehensive upgrade decision tests covering version comparison, downgrade prevention, and edge cases (#421)
- Codespace E2E tests for `GITHUB_TOKEN` filtering, retry caps, and provider initialization (#415)

## [0.5.8] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **dbt commands crash with `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement`** — bundled `dbt-tools/` was missing `package.json` with `"type": "module"`, causing Node to default to CJS and reject ESM imports. Broken since v0.5.3. (#407)
- **Publish script idempotency** — re-running `publish.ts` without cleaning `dist/` would crash because the synthesized `dbt-tools/package.json` (no `name`/`version`) polluted the binary glob scan (#407)
- **Skill builder `ctrl+i` keybind** — ESC navigation and dialog lifecycle fixes in TUI skill management (#386)
- **Upgrade notification silently skipped** — multiple scenarios where the upgrade check was bypassed (#389)
- **Phantom `sql_validate` tool** — removed non-existent tool reference from analyst agent permissions, replaced with `altimate_core_validate` (#352)
- **CI test suite stability** — eliminated 29 pre-existing test failures: added `duckdb` devDependency, fixed native binding contention with retry logic and `beforeAll` connections, increased timeouts for slow bootstrap operations, added `--timeout 30000` to CI workflow (#411)

### Added

- **Trace (session recording)** — session trace with loop detection and enhanced viewer (#381)
- **ESM bundling regression tests** — 9 e2e tests verifying Node can load `altimate-dbt` via symlink, wrapper, and direct invocation paths

### Testing

- 133 new tests across 9 modules: finops role access, tool lookup, config path parsing, ID generation, file ignore/traversal, patch operations, session instructions/messages/summaries, shell utilities (#403)
- SQL validation adversarial + e2e test suites (#352)
- Provider error classification — overflow detection and message extraction (#375)
- Impact analysis DAG traversal and training import parsing (#384)
- RPC client protocol and `abortAfter`/`abortAfterAny` coverage (#382)
- Color, signal, and defer utility coverage (#379)
- MCP config CRUD + Locale utility coverage (#369)

## [0.5.7] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Impact analysis tool** — analyze downstream blast radius of dbt model/column changes across the DAG with severity classification (SAFE/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) and actionable recommendations (#350)
- **Training import tool** — bulk import training entries from markdown style guides, glossaries, and playbooks with dry-run preview and capacity management (#350)
- **CI check command** — `/ci-check` template for pre-merge SQL validation that analyzes changed files, checks dbt integrity, and generates CI-friendly reports (#350)
- **`--max-turns` budget limit** — CLI option to cap agent steps for CI/enterprise governance (#350)
- **LM Studio provider** — local Qwen model support via LM Studio (#340)
- **Improved onboarding** — first-time user hints on home screen, beginner-focused tips, practical quickstart examples (#350)
- **Expanded `/discover`** — detects additional cloud warehouse credentials (Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Databricks, Redshift) (#350)
- **Automated test discovery** — `/test-discovery` command for hourly test generation with critic validation (#364, #365, #366, #367)

### Fixed

- Yolo mode now respects explicit deny rules from session config instead of auto-approving everything (#350)
- Training limits increased from 20→50 entries per kind and 16KB→48KB budget for enterprise teams (#350)

### Testing

- E2E tests for trace viewer with adversarial cases (#353)
- Bash tool PATH injection tests (#366)
- `fn()` wrapper and `skillSource` trust classification tests (#367)
- `AsyncQueue`/`work()` utility and `State.invalidate` coverage (#364)

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Skill CLI command** — new top-level `altimate-code skill` with `list`, `create`, `test`, `show`, `install`, `remove` subcommands for managing AI agent skills and paired CLI tools (#342)
- **`.opencode/tools/` auto-discovery** — executables in `.opencode/tools/` (project) and `~/.config/altimate-code/tools/` (global) are automatically prepended to PATH in BashTool and PTY sessions (#342)
- **TUI skill management** — `/skills` dialog with domain-grouped skill browser, `ctrl+a` action picker (show, edit, test, remove), `ctrl+n` create, `ctrl+i` install from GitHub (#342)
- **Skill install from GitHub** — `altimate-code skill install owner/repo` clones and installs skills; supports GitHub web URLs, shorthand, local paths, and `--global` flag (#342)
- **Skill cache invalidation** — `State.invalidate()` and `Skill.invalidate()` with `GET /skill?reload=true` endpoint for cross-thread cache clearing (#342)
- **Snowflake Cortex AI provider** — use Snowflake Cortex as an AI provider for LLM completions (#349)
- **Telemetry for skill operations** — `skill_created`, `skill_installed`, `skill_removed` events (#342)
- **E2E smoke tests** — committed tests for skill lifecycle, git-tracked protection, symlink safety, GitHub URL normalization (#363)

### Fixed

- Symlink traversal protection during skill install — uses `fs.lstat` to skip symlinks and prevent file disclosure from malicious repos (#342)
- Git-tracked skills cannot be removed via `skill remove` or TUI — prevents accidental deletion of repo-managed skills (#342)
- GitHub web URLs (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/main/path`) correctly normalized to clonable repo URLs (#342)
- `.git` suffix stripped from install source to prevent double-append (#342)
- TUI skill operations use `sdk.directory` + `gitRoot()` instead of `Instance`/`Global` which only exist in the worker thread (#342)
- TUI install uses async `Bun.spawn` instead of blocking `Bun.spawnSync` to keep UI responsive (#342)
- Missing `altimate_change` markers in `dialog-skill.tsx` and `skill.ts` (#341, #344)

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Auto-discover MCP servers from external AI tool configs (VS Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Claude Desktop) — discovered project-scoped servers are disabled by default and require explicit approval; home-directory configs are auto-enabled (#311)
- Security FAQ documentation for MCP auto-discovery — covers trust model, security hardening, and how to disable (#346)

### Changed

- `auto_mcp_discovery` now defaults to `true` in config schema via `z.boolean().default(true)` — matches existing runtime behavior (#345)

### Fixed

- Track per-generation token usage in telemetry — emit `generation` event with flat token fields (`tokens_input`, `tokens_output`, `tokens_reasoning`, `tokens_cache_read`, `tokens_cache_write`) for Azure App Insights compatibility (#336)

### Fixed

- Replace `better-sqlite3` with `bun:sqlite` for schema cache and SQLite driver — fixes `schema_index`, `schema_search`, `schema_cache_status`, and SQLite driver for all users on the released CLI binary (#323)
- Fix marker guard diff parser bug — context lines now correctly update `altimate_change` marker state, preventing false negatives that allowed marker leaks to pass CI (#338)
- Extend marker guard CI to run on push-to-main with zero-SHA guard — closes the gap where individual PRs pass but combined state of `main` has missing markers (#338)
- Add `import.meta.main` guard to `analyze.ts` so test imports don't trigger CLI side effects (#338)
- Add 21 unit tests for marker diff parser and run them in CI (#338)

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Bundle skills, dbt-tools, and altimate-setup in shipped npm binary — skills now work in all distribution channels (npm, Homebrew, AUR, Docker) without relying on `postinstall` filesystem copies (#316)
- Exclude 220MB of unused `.node` binaries from dbt-tools bundle (#320)
- Documentation about warehouse connections updated (#318)

### Changed

- Added `altimate_change` markers to upstream-shared files and marker removal detection to CI — prevents markers from being silently stripped (#322)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Trace history dialog (`/trace` command) — browse, search, and open past session traces from the TUI (#297)
- Docs showcase examples with screenshots (#292)

### Fixed

- TUI trace dialog now respects custom `tracing.dir` config — previously always used default directory (#307)

- Removed brew from docs and README (#299)
- Fixed README typo (`altimate` → `altimate-code`) (#293)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Simplified agent modes: 3 primary modes (`builder`, `analyst`, `plan`) replacing 7 — cleaner UX with focused roles (#282)
- SQL write access control — `builder` prompts for approval on write queries, `analyst` blocks them entirely, destructive SQL (`DROP DATABASE`, `TRUNCATE`) hard-blocked (#282)
- `core_failure` telemetry with PII-safe input signatures — captures tool failures with masked SQL literals and redacted secrets (#245)
- `peerDependencies` for database drivers in published npm packages (#273)
- Comprehensive docs restructuring with new Changelog, Getting Started, and Tools reference pages (#284)

### Fixed

- Replace `escapeSqlString` with parameterized query binds in `finops/schema` modules (#277)

- Docker E2E tests skip in CI unless explicitly opted in (#253)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-16
## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-18

### Breaking Changes

- **Python engine eliminated** — all 73 tool methods now run natively in TypeScript. No Python, pip, venv, or `altimate-engine` installation required. Fixes #210.

### Added

- `@altimateai/drivers` shared workspace package with 10 database drivers (Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Databricks, Redshift, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, DuckDB, SQLite)
- Direct `@altimateai/altimate-core` napi-rs bindings — SQL analysis calls go straight to Rust (no Python intermediary)
- dbt-first SQL execution — automatically uses `profiles.yml` connection when in a dbt project
- Warehouse telemetry (5 event types: connect, query, introspection, discovery, census)
- 340+ new tests including E2E tests against live Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks accounts
- Encrypted key-pair auth support for Snowflake (PKCS8 PEM with passphrase)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Telemetry init: `Config.get()` failure outside Instance context no longer silently disables telemetry
- Telemetry init: called early in CLI middleware and worker thread so MCP/engine/auth events are captured
- Telemetry init: promise deduplication prevents concurrent init race conditions
- Telemetry: pre-init events are now buffered and flushed (previously silently dropped)

- Telemetry: error message truncation standardized to 500 chars across all event types
- Telemetry: `ALTIMATE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` env var now actually checked in init
- Telemetry: MCP disconnect reports correct transport type instead of hardcoded `stdio`

### Changed

- Auth telemetry events use session context when available instead of hardcoded `"cli"`

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-05

- Comprehensive telemetry instrumentation: 25 event types across auth, MCP servers, Python engine, provider errors, permissions, upgrades, context utilization, agent outcomes, workflow sequencing, and environment census
- Telemetry docs page with event table, privacy policy, opt-out instructions, and contributor guide
- AppInsights endpoint added to network firewall documentation
- `categorizeToolName()` helper for tool classification (sql, schema, dbt, finops, warehouse, lineage, file, mcp)
