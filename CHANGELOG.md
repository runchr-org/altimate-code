## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Telemetry init: `Config.get()` failure outside Instance context no longer silently disables telemetry
- Telemetry init: called early in CLI middleware and worker thread so MCP/engine/auth events are captured
- Telemetry init: promise deduplication prevents concurrent init race conditions
- Telemetry: pre-init events are now buffered and flushed (previously silently dropped)
- Telemetry: user email is SHA-256 hashed before sending (privacy)
- Telemetry: error message truncation standardized to 500 chars across all event types
- Telemetry: `ALTIMATE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` env var now actually checked in init
- Telemetry: MCP disconnect reports correct transport type instead of hardcoded `stdio`
- Telemetry: `agent_outcome` now correctly reports `"error"` outcome for failed sessions

### Changed

- Auth telemetry events use session context when available instead of hardcoded `"cli"`

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Comprehensive telemetry instrumentation: 25 event types across auth, MCP servers, Python engine, provider errors, permissions, upgrades, context utilization, agent outcomes, workflow sequencing, and environment census
- Telemetry docs page with event table, privacy policy, opt-out instructions, and contributor guide
- AppInsights endpoint added to network firewall documentation
- `categorizeToolName()` helper for tool classification (sql, schema, dbt, finops, warehouse, lineage, file, mcp)
- `bucketCount()` helper for privacy-safe count bucketing

### Fixed

- Command loading made resilient to MCP/Skill initialization failures

### Changed

- CLI binary renamed from `altimate-code` to `altimate`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Context management: auto-compaction with overflow recovery, observation masking, and loop protection
- Context management: data-engineering-aware compaction template preserving warehouse, schema, dbt, and lineage context
- Context management: content-aware token estimation (code, JSON, SQL, text heuristics)
- Context management: observation masking replaces pruned tool outputs with fingerprinted summaries
- Context management: provider overflow detection for Azure OpenAI patterns
- CLI observability: telemetry module with session, generation, tool call, and error tracking
- `/discover` command for data stack setup with project_scan tool
- User documentation for context management configuration

### Fixed

- ContextOverflowError now triggers automatic compaction instead of a dead-end error
- `isOverflow()` correctly reserves headroom for models with separate input/output limits
- `NamedError.isInstance()` no longer crashes on null input
- Text part duration tracking now preserves original start timestamp
- Compaction loop protection: max 3 consecutive attempts per turn, counter resets between turns
- Negative usable context guard for models where headroom exceeds base capacity

### Changed

- Removed cost estimation and complexity scoring bindings
- Docs: redesigned homepage with hero, feature cards, and pill layouts
- Docs: reorganized sidebar navigation for better discoverability
